Title: ML Tests for Effects on Rich Outcomes

Description: An implementation and extension of the tests for multiple dependent variables
    detailed in (Ludwig, Speiss & Mullainathan, 2017), while properly adjusting
    for multiple comparisons. Functions herein allow users to test for differences
    in rich DVs with exactly sized hypothesis tests--the family-wise error rate can be
    perfectly known and controlled. "Rich" outcomes are either rich because there are many of them
    or because they are non numeric (e.g., free-text responses).
